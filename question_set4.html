    <div><ol>
        <li>Describe the shape and characteristics of a normal distribution curve. (5pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>How do we derive the z-score of a given variable from a normal distribution?</li>
        <br>
        <li>What does this indicate in Poisson distribution? λ (5pts)</li>

        <li>Market Researchers, Inc., has been hired to perform
a study to determine if the market for a new product
will be good or poor. In similar studies performed
in the past, whenever the market actually was good,
the market research study indicated that it would
be good 85% of the time. On the other hand, whenever
the market actually was poor, the market study
incorrectly predicted it would be good 20% of the
time. Before the study is performed, it is believed
there is a 70% chance the market will be good.
When Market Researchers, Inc., performs the study
for this product, the results predict the market will
be good. Given the results of this study, what is the
probability that the market actually will be good?</li>

        <li>Nite Time Inn has a toll-free telephone number so
that customers can call at any time to make a reservation.
A typical call takes about 4 minutes to complete,
and the time required follows an exponential
distribution. Find the probability that a call takes 5 minutes or less (5pts)</li>
