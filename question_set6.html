        <li>What is the relationship between variance and standard deviation? (5pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Explain conditional probability. (5pts) </li>
        <br>
        <li>Define collectively exhaustive events. Give an example. (5pts)</li>

        <li>A construction company has taken up a project to
build a high-rise office complex. The time required
to complete a construction project is normally distributed
with a mean of 80 weeks and a standard deviation
of 10 weeks. A construction company must
pay a penalty if the project is not finished by the due
date in the contract. If a construction company bidding on this contract
puts in a due date of 80 weeks, what is the
probability that they will have to pay a penalty? (5pts)</li>

        <li>Burger City is a large chain of fast-food restaurants
specializing in gourmet hamburgers. A mathematical
model is now used to predict the success
of new restaurants based on location and demographic
information for that area. In the past, 70%
of all restaurants that were opened were successful.
The mathematical model has been tested in
the existing restaurants to determine how effective
it is. For the restaurants that were successful, 90% of the time the model predicted they would be,
while 10% of the time the model predicted a failure.
For the restaurants that were not successful,
when the mathematical model was applied, 20%
of the time it incorrectly predicted a successful
restaurant, while 80% of the time it was accurate
and predicted an unsuccessful restaurant. If the
model is used on a new location and predicts the
restaurant will be successful, what is the probability
that it actually is successful? (5pts)</li>
