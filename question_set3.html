    <div><ol>
        <li>Give at least two properties of the bernoulli distribution. (5pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Can a poisson variable be a negative number? Why? (5 pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Steve Goodman, production foreman for the Florida
Gold Fruit Company, estimates that the average sale
of oranges is 4,700 and the standard deviation is 500
oranges. Sales follow a normal distribution. What is the probability that sales will be greater
than 5,500 oranges? (5pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gary Schwartz is the top salesman for his company.
Records indicate that he makes a sale on 70% of his
sales calls. If he calls on four potential clients, what is
the probability that he makes exactly 3 sales? (5pts)</li>
        <br>
        <li>A local company that provides home repair services
for appliances has two repairmen who make all of
the home repairs. The company sends Repairman D
on 70% of all jobs because the likelihood of him getting
a second follow-up call within a week is only
0.08, whereas the probability of Repairman K getting
a second follow-up call within a week is 0.20.
If you recently had a repair job done at your home
and it requires a second follow-up call, what is the
probability that Repairman K did your initial repair
work? (5pts)</li>
